# RPiAirPlayMix

## What is it?
RPIAirPlayMix is a mixture of two existing repositories to allow a better user experience and simulate a better reality.

It uses [`RPiPlay`](https://github.com/FD-/RPiPlay) by `FD-` (Which was forked from [`AirplayServer`](https://github.com/) by `dsafa22`) and it also uses `Shairport` by `abrasive` which [Can be found here...](https://github.com/abrasive/shairport)

Using both existing solutions, I am planning to create a new way of merging both solutions to one raspberry pi. In addition, an easier setup for the user will be made, where they will be able to choose optional modules like a Web Application. If chosen, it will help the user to change the settings and support creating a headless Raspberry Pi.

It is being tested on a ***Raspberry Pi B Rev 2.1 (UK)*** and is planned to be tested on Raspberry Pi 3B+ as well.
Testing will not go on to Raspberry Pi 4 as I do not own one.

## Credits

I would like to thank both `FD-` and `dsafa22` for creating these solutions. The Airplay-side work is only implented by them, and the ones described in their repositories. I have only created the Web Interface and the Shell files to change the settings of these servers.
